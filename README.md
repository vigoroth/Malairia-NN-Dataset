# Malaria Cell Classification using CNNs

This repository contains code to classify malaria-infected cells using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The dataset used is from TensorFlow Datasets.

## Overview

The project aims to build and train a CNN model to distinguish between parasitized and uninfected malaria cells based on microscopic images.

## Setup
